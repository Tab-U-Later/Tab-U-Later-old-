# GroupMyTabs
A chrome extension for grouping tabs together so that you can go back to them at another time. This takes away the frustration of leaving windows open for several days just so that one does not lose their browsing history. 

A user is able to group selected tabs in their window into a session. Once they name the session, they can open, remove, and edit.
